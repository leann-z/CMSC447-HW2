In order to run this flask application:

1) open "hw2" folder in any IDE or terminal.
2) If database.db is not available, there is a "init_db.py" python file that, when ran, creates a database.db file. However, I am submitting the database.db file I've been testing with so it should be fine.
3) Run the "flask run" command. When doing so, it will give you an address (the one I got while running my flask app is "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"). When opening this address on any browser, the website should be there.
